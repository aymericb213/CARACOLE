# A user-centered framework for incremental and active clustering

This repository contains the experimental setup, data, and plots used in the PAKDD'23 submission titled "A user-centered framework for incremental and active clustering".

Our experimental setup is available is a binary executable. Source code will be shared upon acceptation of this paper.

Plots are HTML files generated by Plotly, they are interactive and thus offer a better view on our results.

The data contains :
- the measures of clustering quality, clustering similarity and runtime at each iteration of the 6 compared setups on 50 runs for 10 datasets
- the same measures for the experiments on relaxed constraints, along with the number of relaxed constraints for each method on 100 runs
- the computed partitions, cluster assignments and user constraints used in the tree cut use case

The experiments can be reproduced by running the executable, opening a CLI menu to choose an experiment. The results will be written in a folder named "reproduced_results".

Concerning the use case experiments, the images in the paper were assembled from layers with Gimp. The executable will reproduce the layers, not the composite images.

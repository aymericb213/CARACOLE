This repository contains the experimental setup, data, and plots used in the PAKDD'23 submission titled "A user-centered framework for incremental and active clustering".

Our experimental setup is available is a binary executable. Source code will be shared upon acceptation of this paper.

Plots are HTML files generated by Plotly, they are interactive.

The data contains :
- the measures of clustering quality, clustering similarity and runtime at each iteration of the 6 compared setups on 50 runs for 10 datasets
- the same measures for the experiments on relaxed constraints, along with the number of relaxed constraints for each method on 100 runs
- the computed partitions for the tree cut use case

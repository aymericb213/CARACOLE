# Incremental Constrained Clustering by Minimal Weighted Modification

This repository contains the experimental setup, data, and plots used in the CP'23 contribution titled "Incremental Constrained Clustering by Minimal Weighted Modification" (paper **38**).

***

Plots are HTML files generated by Plotly, they are interactive and thus offer a better view on our results.

Folders *clustering-data-v1-1.1.0* and *datasets* contain the datasets used in the experiments, pulled from the *clustering-benchmarks* library except for *Letters* which comes directly from the UCI repository. Folder *use case* contains all the data pertaining to the experiment on tree cut SITS presented in Section 4.3 of the paper.
Finally, the *experiments* folder contains all of the experimental results, including:

- the measures of clustering quality, clustering similarity and runtime at each iteration of the setups for each experiment on reference datasets
- the computed partitions, cluster assignments and user constraints used in the tree cut use case

The experiments can be reproduced by running the executable, opening a CLI menu to choose an experiment. The results will be written in a folder named "reproduced_results".

Concerning the use case experiments, the images in the paper were assembled from layers with Gimp. The executable will reproduce the layers, not the composite images.

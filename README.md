# Incremental Constrained Clustering by Minimal Weighted Modification

This repository contains the experimental setup, data, and plots used in the CP'23 submission titled "Incremental Constrained Clustering by Minimal Weighted Modification" (submission 107).

Our experimental setup is available is a binary executable. Source code will be shared upon acceptation of this paper.
Due to file size limitations, we stored the executable in anonymous [cloud storage](https://drive.proton.me/urls/5Q8DHMSSYW#0qj9E4Yk8wNI). 
On Linux, execution rights must be given to the executable in order to run it.
The executable is expected to be run at the root of this repository.

```
sudo chmod +x IAC_experiments
./IAC_experiments
```

Plots are HTML files generated by Plotly, they are interactive and thus offer a better view on our results.

The data contains :
- a copy of the dataset files from the *clustering-benchmarks* library that were used in the experiments
- the measures of clustering quality, clustering similarity and runtime at each iteration of the 6 compared setups on 90 runs for 16 datasets
- the same measures for the experiments on relaxed constraints, along with the number of relaxed constraints for each method on 100 runs
- the computed partitions, cluster assignments and user constraints used in the tree cut use case

The experiments can be reproduced by running the executable, opening a CLI menu to choose an experiment. The results will be written in a folder named "reproduced_results".

Concerning the use case experiments, the images in the paper were assembled from layers with Gimp. The executable will reproduce the layers, not the composite images.
